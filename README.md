Java-Blocklists: Blocking Creepy Scripts, One Script at a Time


Hey Guys! I Found that While Brave does a Good Job of Tracking Creepy ADs & Trackers across the Web, there are Some Creepy Scripts such as the Infamous "Google Tag Manager", that like to Keep Tabs on You throught the Web

I'd like to Support the FOSS Community by Making a List, so that Privacy Based Browsers such as Mullvad & Brave can Implement a List of Creepy Scripts while also having the Ability to Browse with Ease

I Wanted to Make this Open Source, so that Anyone Could Add & Contribute. I'll Try my Best to Keep it as Up to Date as Possible. Please Let Me Know if you have any Suggestions & Would like to Share

Thank you all in Advance & Have a Wonderful Day!!!
